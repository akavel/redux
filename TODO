optimization -- rewrite redoTarget with sets:

  old = existing prerequisite keys
  new = new prerequisites keys
  
  deletes = old - new
  writes = new - old
  # updates
  for each file in old && new
      if !file.IsCurrent() {
          add file to deletes 
          add file to writes

  delete(deletes)
  put(writes)
  
  In most cases, this will eliminate a number of redundant operations.
***
  Add debug flag. Change verbosity > 2 behaviour to use debug
***
  verbosity should show
        do file selected
        file stats for generated output
***
  Add mechanism to run parallel jobs
