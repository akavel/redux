/*

redux is a library for redux, a top down software build tool
which implements and extends the redo concept somewhat sparsely
described by [DJ Bernstein](http://cr.yp.to/redo.html).

To install it, run

    $ go get github.com/gyepisam/redux/redux

The command

	$ redux help

provides built-in help, which is augmented by the html, man
pages and the README file.
