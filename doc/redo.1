.SH NOTES
.PP
The redo command builds files atomically by running a do script
asssociated with the target.
.PP
redo normally requires one or more target arguments.
If no target arguments are provided, redo searches for the script
\@all.do in the current directory, and runs it if found.
%!(EXTRA string=\@all, string=\@all.do)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command can be invoked as \f[C]redux\ redo\f[] or, through a
symlink, as \f[C]redo\f[].
.PP
A redo target is produced by an sh script whose name has a \[aq].do\[aq]
file extension and, as such, is called a do script.
.PP
For a given target named \f[C]target.ext\f[], the corresponding do file
may be named, in order of decreasing specificity,
\f[C]target.ext.do\f[], \f[C]default.ext.do\f[] or, finally,
\f[C]default.do\f[].
.PP
Redo searches for each of these script files, in order of specificity,
starting in the target\[aq]s directory and moving into parent
directories.
The search stops when a script is found or when the project root
directory has been unsuccessfully searched.
.PP
In the latter case, if the target file exists on disk, it is taken to be
a source file, not generated by script and its metadata is stored in the
database.
The file will be subsequently watched for changes.
.PP
In the former case, where the script is found, it is assumed to be an sh
script and executed with three arguments:
.PP
$1 = path to target, relative to do script directory $2 = basename of
target without a suffix $3 = temporary file name
.PP
The script is executed by /bin/sh with the current working directory
(cwd) set to its directory and with stdout opened to a temporary file
(which is unnamed and different from $3).
It is normally expected to produce output on stdout or write to the file
specified by its $3 parameter.
It is an error for a script to write to both outputs.
.PP
If the script completes successfuly, redo chooses the correct output,
renames the temporary file to the target file and updates its database
with the new file\[aq]s metadata record.
Since only one of the two temporary files can have content, redo has no
trouble selecting the correct one.
Conversely, if neither file has content, then either is a valid
candidate.
.PP
In the do file, which is an sh script, the line
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
redo-ifchange\ A\ B\ C
\f[]
.fi
.PP
specifies the files A, B, and C as prerequisites for the target file.
.PP
Similarly, a call to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
redo-ifcreate\ A
\f[]
.fi
.PP
specifies that the target should be rebuilt when the non-existent file A
appears or is deleted.
.PP
As a special case, a do file whose name is prefixed with \[aq]\@\[aq] is
run for side effect.
redux does not create a temporary file when running such a file and uses
\[aq]/dev/stdout\[aq] as the output file name so its output is visible
but is otherwise not saved.
While the $3 parameter is provided for consistency, it is an error for a
task script to write to it since its output is discarded.
.PP
A call to redo without an argument will search for a file named
\f[C]\@all.do\f[] in the current directory.
.PP
A \[aq]\@\[aq] prefixed task is analogous to a \f[C].PHONY\f[] target in
make.
Any do file can also be run as a task by invoking \[aq]redo\[aq] with
the \[aq]-task\[aq] flag.
